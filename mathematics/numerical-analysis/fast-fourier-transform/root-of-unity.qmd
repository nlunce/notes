## **Overview**

Roots of unity are solutions to the equation:

$$
z^n = 1
$$

where $z$ is a number (real or complex) and $n$ is a positive integer. These solutions represent the numbers that, when multiplied by themselves $n$ times, equal 1.

## **Roots of Unity in Real Numbers**

### **What Are They?**

In the real numbers, the equation $z^n = 1$ has at most two solutions:

1. $z = 1$ (the trivial solution).
2. $z = -1$, but only when $n$ is even.

### **Primitive Roots in Real Numbers**

Primitive roots of unity are roots that **generate all roots of unity through their powers**. In the real numbers:

- $z = 1$: Trivial root, but it cannot generate anything else. Not primitive.
- $z = -1$: Primitive for even $n$, as it alternates between $1$ and $-1$.

Thus, in the real numbers:

- For $n = 2$, the primitive root is $-1$.
- For $n > 2$, there are no new primitive roots in the reals.

This limitation motivates expanding the idea to the **complex plane**.

## **Extending Roots of Unity to the Complex Plane**

### **Complex Roots of Unity**

To find all solutions to $z^n = 1$ in the complex plane, we use **Euler’s formula**:

$$
z = e^{i \theta} = \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle (in radians) of $z$ on the unit circle in the complex plane. The general solution to $z^n = 1$ is:

$$
z_k = e^{i \frac{2\pi k}{n}}, \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n-1
$$

These solutions are the **$n$-th roots of unity**. They are equally spaced points on the unit circle, with angles:

$$
\theta_k = \frac{2\pi k}{n}
$$

### **Example: 4th Roots of Unity ($n = 4$)**

For $z^4 = 1$, the roots are:

1. $z_0 = e^{i \frac{2\pi \cdot 0}{4}} = e^{i 0} = 1$
2. $z_1 = e^{i \frac{2\pi \cdot 1}{4}} = e^{i \frac{\pi}{2}} = i$
3. $z_2 = e^{i \frac{2\pi \cdot 2}{4}} = e^{i \pi} = -1$
4. $z_3 = e^{i \frac{2\pi \cdot 3}{4}} = e^{i \frac{3\pi}{2}} = -i$

These roots are $\{1, i, -1, -i\}$, representing four equally spaced points on the unit circle.

## **Primitive Roots of Unity**

### **What Makes a Root Primitive?**

A root of unity $z$ is **primitive** if it generates all $n$-th roots of unity through its successive powers.

Formally:

- $z$ is primitive if $z^k \neq 1$ for $1 \leq k < n$, and $z^n = 1$

### **Example: Primitive Roots for $n = 4$**

The 4th roots of unity are $\{1, i, -1, -i\}$. Let’s test each root:

1. $z = 1$: $1^k = 1$ for all $k$. Not primitive.
2. $z = i$:
   - $i^1 = i$
   - $i^2 = -1$
   - $i^3 = -i$
   - $i^4 = 1$ (cycles through all roots) **Primitive**
3. $z = -1$:
   - $(-1)^1 = -1$,
   - $(-1)^2 = 1$ (only alternates between $-1$ and $1$). Not primitive.
4. $z = -i$:
   - $(-i)^1 = -i$
   - $(-i)^2 = -1$
   - $(-i)^3 = i$
   - $(-i)^4 = 1$ **Primitive**

Thus, the primitive roots for $n = 4$ are $i$ and $-i$.

## **Visualizing Roots of Unity**

Roots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, evenly spaced at angles $\frac{2\pi}{n}$. For $n = 4$:

- $z_0 = 1$ at $0^\circ$
- $z_1 = i$ at $90^\circ$
- $z_2 = -1$ at $180^\circ$
- $z_3 = -i$ at $270^\circ$

Primitive roots, like $i$, act as the "generator," visiting each point exactly once when raised to successive powers.

## **Applications of Roots of Unity**

1. **In Algebra**:  
   Roots of unity are solutions to the polynomial $z^n - 1 = 0$, foundational in field theory and Galois theory.

2. **In Fourier Analysis**:  
   The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) uses primitive roots to decompose signals into frequency components.

3. **In Number Theory**:  
   Roots of unity appear in modular arithmetic, cyclotomic fields, and cryptography.

## **Summary**

- **Real Numbers**: Only $1$ and $-1$ are roots of unity, and $-1$ is primitive for $n = 2$.
- **Complex Plane**: Extending to complex numbers introduces all $n$-th roots of unity, equally spaced on the unit circle.
- **Primitive Roots**: These roots generate all other roots through successive powers, playing a central role in algebra, signal processing, and number theory.
