## **Overview**

LU Factorization (or LU Decomposition) is a powerful technique in linear algebra for breaking down a matrix $A$ into the product of a lower triangular matrix $L$ and an upper triangular matrix $U$. This factorization is commonly used for solving linear systems, computing determinants, and inverting matrices.

## **Definition and Decomposition**

For a square matrix $A$, LU Factorization is given by:

$$
A = LU
$$

where:

- $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal.
- $U$ is an upper triangular matrix.

If $A$ cannot be decomposed directly, **partial pivoting** may be applied, resulting in:

$$
PA = LU
$$

where $P$ is a permutation matrix that records row exchanges.

## **Why You Subtract Rows**

When performing row operations to compute $LU$, the operation for row elimination is explicitly written as:

$$
R_j \to R_j - L_{ij} R_i
$$

where:

- $R_i$ is the pivot row.
- $R_j$ is the row being updated.
- $L_{ij} = \frac{a_{ji}}{a_{ii}}$ is the multiplier used to eliminate the element $a_{ji}$.

### **Importance of Subtraction:**

- **Correct Multiplier Signs:** Subtracting ensures that the multiplier $L_{ij}$ is stored with its correct sign in the $L$-matrix.
- **Consistency in Computation:** Adding the negative version (i.e., $R_j \to R_j + (-L_{ij} R_i)$) can lead to confusion and sign errors in $L_{ij}$, even though it seems conceptually similar.
- **Preventing Errors:** Adding instead of subtracting might inadvertently reverse the signs of the entries in $L$, causing errors in the final decomposition.

### **Example of a Sign Error:**

Suppose we start with the matrix:

$$
A = \begin{bmatrix}
4 & 8 & -4 \\
-1 & 1 & -2 \\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

1. **Correct Subtraction:**

   Compute $L_{21} = \frac{-1}{4}$, and perform $R_2 \to R_2 - L_{21} R_1$:

   $$
   L_{21} = \frac{-1}{4}, \quad R_2 \to R_2 - L_{21} R_1
   $$

   Result:

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   4 & 8 & -4 \\
   0 & 3 & -3 \\
   2 & 3 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   The multiplier $L_{21} = \frac{-1}{4}$ is correctly stored.

2. **Adding the Negative Version:**

   If we compute $R_2 \to R_2 + (-L_{21} R_1)$, we might misinterpret $-L_{21} = \frac{1}{4}$ as $+\frac{1}{4}$:

   $$
   L_{21} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad R_2 \to R_2 + (-L_{21} R_1)
   $$

   Result:

   $$
   \begin{bmatrix}
   4 & 8 & -4 \\
   0 & -3 & +3 \\
   2 & 3 & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   $$

   Here, $L_{21}$ would have the wrong sign in the $L$-matrix, leading to incorrect results.

## **Conditions for LU Factorization**

LU Factorization is valid when:

1. **Matrix is Square**: $A$ must be a square matrix.
2. **Non-Singular Leading Submatrices**: Each leading principal submatrix (upper-left submatrix) of $A$ must be non-singular.

When these conditions are not met, row pivoting enables decomposition.

## **Factorization Process**

To factorize $A$ into $L$ and $U$:

1. **Eliminate Elements**: Perform row operations to create zeros below the main diagonal of $U$.
2. **Store Multipliers**: Record the multipliers in $L$.

### **Example**

Given a $3 \times 3$ matrix:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 & 1 \\ 4 & 7 & -1 \\ -2 & 3 & 5 \end{pmatrix}
$$

1. Transform $A$ into $U$ using row operations.
2. Record elimination factors in $L$.
3. The result satisfies $A = LU$.

## **Solving Systems with LU Factorization**

LU Factorization allows us to solve $Ax = b$ by breaking it down into two simpler systems:

1. **Solve $Ly = b$**: Use forward substitution, as $L$ is lower triangular.
2. **Solve $Ux = y$**: Use back substitution with $U$ as an upper triangular matrix.

## **Pivoting and Permutation**

In cases where $A$ has zeros or small values on the diagonal, **partial pivoting** improves numerical stability by reordering rows to place a larger element on the diagonal:

$$
PA = LU
$$

where $P$ is a permutation matrix that tracks row exchanges.

## **Conclusion**

LU Factorization is an essential tool in linear algebra, providing a simplified method to solve linear systems efficiently. By breaking matrices into triangular forms, it reduces computational complexity and lays the groundwork for more advanced numerical techniques. Always remember to **subtract row operations consistently** to avoid sign errors and ensure correct results.
