## **Overview**

The **Taxicab norm** (also known as the Manhattan norm or $\ell_1$-norm) is a way of measuring the "distance" of a vector in a grid-like space. Unlike the [**Euclidean**](./euclidean-vector-norm.html) norm, which measures the straight-line distance, the Taxicab norm sums the absolute values of a vector's components. It is often used in scenarios where movement is constrained to axes, like navigating a city grid.

## **Definition**

For a vector $\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n]$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, the Taxicab norm is defined as:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = \sum_{i=1}^n |v_i|
$$

This measures the total "travel distance" required along the axes to reach the endpoint of the vector.

## **Properties**

The Taxicab norm satisfies the following properties:

1. **Non-negativity**: $\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 \geq 0$, and $\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = 0$ if and only if $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}$.
2. **Homogeneity**: For any scalar $c$, $\|c \mathbf{v}\|_1 = |c| \|\mathbf{v}\|_1$.
3. **Triangle Inequality**: $\|\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}\|_1 \leq \|\mathbf{u}\|_1 + \|\mathbf{v}\|_1$.

## **Examples**

### **1. 2D Example**

For $\mathbf{v} = [3, -4]$:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = |3| + |-4| = 3 + 4 = 7
$$

### **2. 3D Example**

For $\mathbf{v} = [1, -2, 3]$:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = |1| + |-2| + |3| = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
$$

### **3. General Case**

For $\mathbf{v} = [v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n]$:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = |v_1| + |v_2| + \cdots + |v_n|
$$

## **Applications**

### **1. Urban Navigation**

The Taxicab norm models distance in grid-based systems, such as city streets, where movement is restricted to horizontal and vertical directions.

### **2. Machine Learning**

In machine learning, the $\ell_1$-norm is used as a regularization term (Lasso regression) to encourage sparsity in models.

### **3. Optimization**

The Taxicab norm is used in linear programming and optimization problems where constraints align with the $\ell_1$-metric.

### **4. Signal Processing**

The $\ell_1$-norm is used in compressed sensing and sparse recovery to find solutions with minimal non-zero components.

## **Visualization**

In 2D, the set of points at a fixed Taxicab norm distance from the origin forms a diamond shape (rotated square). For example, all points satisfying $\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = 3$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ would form the square:

$$
|x| + |y| = 3
$$

## **Example Problem**

**Problem:** Compute the Taxicab norm of $\mathbf{v} = [-3, 4, -5]$.

### **Solution:**

1. Take the absolute values of the components: $|-3| = 3$, $|4| = 4$, $|-5| = 5$.
2. Sum them: $\|\mathbf{v}\|_1 = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12$.

## **Conclusion**

The Taxicab norm is a useful measure of distance in grid-based systems and finds applications in various fields such as geometry, optimization, and machine learning. Its simplicity and intuitive interpretation make it a valuable tool for analyzing vector magnitudes under $\ell_1$-metrics.
