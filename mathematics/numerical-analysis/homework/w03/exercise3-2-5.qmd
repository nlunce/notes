## **Problem:**

**How do we construct a polynomial of degree exactly 5 that interpolates four points?**

Given four points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(4, 4)$, the standard interpolation methods (such as Newton’s or Lagrange’s methods) would give us a unique polynomial of degree 3. However, constructing a polynomial of degree exactly 5 requires a different approach.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Theorem 3.2** (Main Theorem of Polynomial Interpolation) guarantees that a unique polynomial of degree $n-1$ exists for $n$ distinct points.
2. To create a polynomial of degree 5 when you only have 4 points, you need to add an **extra term** that still passes through all the original points but elevates the polynomial’s degree.

### **Solution:**

To create a degree 5 polynomial that still passes through all four points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(4, 4)$, follow these steps:

1. **Find the degree 3 polynomial $P_3(x)$:**

   - Use either **Newton’s divided differences** or **Lagrange interpolation** to find the polynomial of degree 3 that passes through the given points. Let’s call this polynomial $P_3(x)$.

2. **Add a higher-degree term:**
   - To turn this degree 3 polynomial into a degree 5 polynomial, we add a term that evaluates to zero at the given points:

$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$

- The new term $(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$ is zero at $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, so it won’t affect the interpolation at those points. By multiplying this term by a constant $c$, we ensure that the degree of the polynomial is elevated to 5, but the polynomial still interpolates the original points.

### **Final Degree 5 Polynomial**

Thus, the degree 5 polynomial is given by:

$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$

- $P_3(x)$ is the degree 3 polynomial found using standard interpolation methods.
- $c$ is an arbitrary constant that determines the shape of the polynomial outside the interpolation points.

### **Example**

Let’s assume the degree 3 polynomial $P_3(x)$ through the points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 4)$ is:

$$P_3(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) + 3(x - 1)(x - 2)$$

Then the degree 5 polynomial becomes:

$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$

### **Does the Value of $c$ Matter?**

No, the value of $c$ does not affect the interpolation at the given points. Since the additional term evaluates to 0 at $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, the polynomial will still pass through the points, regardless of $c$.

However, changing $c$ affects the behavior of the polynomial **outside** the interpolation points. For different values of $c$, the polynomial will look different beyond the four points, but it will still pass through $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3) $, $ (3, 3) $, and $ (4, 4)$.
