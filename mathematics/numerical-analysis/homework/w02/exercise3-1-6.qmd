## **Question**

**How do we construct a polynomial of degree exactly 5 that interpolates four points?**

Given four points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(4, 4)$, the standard interpolation methods (such as [**Newton’s**](../../notes/w02/newtons-divided-differences.html) or [**Lagrange’s**](../../notes/w02/lagrange-interpolation.html) methods) would give us a unique polynomial of degree 3. However, constructing a polynomial of degree exactly 5 requires a different approach.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Theorem 3.2** (Main Theorem of Polynomial Interpolation) guarantees that a unique polynomial of degree $n-1$ exists for $n$ distinct points.
2. To create a polynomial of degree 5 when you only have 4 points, you need to add an **extra term** that still passes through all the original points but elevates the polynomial’s degree.

### **Using Newton's Divided Differences**

We will use Newton’s divided differences to first construct the degree 3 polynomial, and then extend it to a degree 5 polynomial.

### **1. Construct the Newton Divided Difference Table:**

We will use the given points $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 1)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (2, 3)$, $(x_3, y_3) = (3, 3)$, and $(x_4, y_4) = (4, 4)$ to compute the divided differences and build the polynomial.

| $x$ | $f(x)$ | First Difference $f[x_i, x_{i+1}]$ | Second Difference $f[x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}]$ | Third Difference $f[x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}, x_{i+3}]$           |
| --- | ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | 1      |                                    |                                              |                                                                |
| 2   | 3      | $\frac{3 - 1}{2 - 1} = 2$          |                                              |                                                                |
| 3   | 3      | $\frac{3 - 3}{3 - 2} = 0$          | $\frac{0 - 2}{3 - 1} = -1$                   |                                                                |
| 4   | 4      | $\frac{4 - 3}{4 - 3} = 1$          | $\frac{1 - 0}{4 - 2} = \frac{1}{2}$          | $\frac{\frac{1}{2} - (-1)}{4 - 1} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ |

### **2. Construct the Degree 3 Polynomial $P_3(x)$:**

The Newton's divided difference form of the interpolating polynomial is:

$$
P_3(x) = f[x_1] + f[x_1, x_2](x - x_1) + f[x_1, x_2, x_3](x - x_1)(x - x_2) + f[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4](x - x_1)(x - x_2)(x - x_3)
$$

Substituting the values from the divided difference table:

$$
P_3(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) - (x - 1)(x - 2) + \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)
$$

### **3. Extend to Degree 5 Polynomial $P_5(x)$:**

To create a degree 5 polynomial, we add an extra term $c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$, which evaluates to zero at the given points:

$$
P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)
$$

Substitute $P_3(x)$:

$$
P_5(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) - (x - 1)(x - 2) + \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)
$$

### **4. Does the Value of $c$ Matter?**

The value of $c$ does not affect the polynomial at the given points. The additional term evaluates to 0 at $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, so no matter what $c$ is, the polynomial will pass through the points $(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4)$.

However, changing $c$ will affect the polynomial's behavior outside the given points. For different values of $c$, the polynomial will look different outside the interpolation points.

### **Final Degree 5 Polynomial**

Thus, the degree 5 polynomial is:

$$
P_5(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) - (x - 1)(x - 2) + \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)
$$

This polynomial passes through the points $(1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3), (4, 4)$, and $c$ is an arbitrary constant that influences how the polynomial behaves outside of those points.
