## **Problem Statement**

Let $p_{n-1}(x)$ be the degree $n-1$ polynomial that interpolates the points $(x_i, f(x_i))$, where $i = 1, \dots, n$. Now, suppose we add a new point $(x, f(x))$ and assume that $a$ is chosen such that the polynomial

$$
p_n(t) = p_{n-1}(t) + a(t - x_1)(t - x_2)\dots(t - x_n)
$$

interpolates the point $(x, f(x))$ in addition to the original $n$ points $(x_i, f(x_i))$, $i = 1, \dots, n$.

Then $h(t) = f(t) - p_n(t)$ must have at least $n+1$ roots. **What are these roots?**

## **Solution**

### **1. Analyze the roots of $h(t)$**

By definition:

$$
h(t) = f(t) - p_n(t)
$$

Since $p_n(t)$ interpolates $f(x)$ at $n+1$ points (the original $n$ points and the newly added point $(x, f(x))$), $h(t)$ is zero at these $n+1$ points. Therefore, the roots of $h(t)$ include:

1. The original interpolation points: $t = x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$
2. The newly added point: $t = x$

Thus, the roots of $h(t)$ are $\{ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, x \}$.

### **2. Polynomial degree and root count**

The degree of $p_n(t)$ is $n$, since $p_n(t)$ adds a single term of degree $n$ to $p_{n-1}(t)$. Therefore, $h(t) = f(t) - p_n(t)$, being the difference of two degree $n$ polynomials, is also a degree $n$ polynomial.

However, since $h(t)$ is zero at $n+1$ distinct points, $h(t)$ must be identically zero if $f(t)$ is a polynomial of degree at most $n$. Otherwise, $f(t)$ introduces higher-order terms that cancel the polynomial structure of $p_n(t)$.

### **Conclusion**

The $n+1$ roots of $h(t) = f(t) - p_n(t)$ are precisely:

$$
x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, x
$$
