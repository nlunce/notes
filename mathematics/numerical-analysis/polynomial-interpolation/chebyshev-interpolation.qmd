Chebyshev Interpolation is a powerful technique in numerical analysis used to approximate functions with polynomials, particularly minimizing errors and avoiding issues like [**Runge's phenomenon**](./runge-phenomenon.html). This note provides an overview of Chebyshev Interpolation, including its definition, properties, advantages, and practical implementation.

## **Introduction**

Interpolation involves approximating a function $f(x)$ using a polynomial $P_n(x)$ that passes through a set of points (nodes). While polynomial interpolation is straightforward, selecting appropriate nodes is crucial to ensure accuracy and stability. Chebyshev Interpolation leverages Chebyshev nodes to construct interpolating polynomials that minimize the maximum error across the interpolation interval.

## **Chebyshev Polynomials**

Chebyshev polynomials are a sequence of orthogonal polynomials that arise in various approximation and interpolation problems. They are defined recursively and have properties that make them ideal for minimizing interpolation errors.

### **Definition**

The Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, $T_n(x)$, are defined by:

$$
T_n(x) = \cos(n \arccos x), \quad \text{for } x \in [-1, 1]
$$

### **Properties**

- **Orthogonality**: Chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal with respect to the weight $w(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}$ on the interval $[-1, 1]$.

- **Extremal Property**: Among all polynomials of degree $n$ with leading coefficient $2^{n-1}$, $T_n(x)$ has the smallest maximum deviation from zero on $[-1, 1]$.

- **Roots and Extremes**: The roots of $T_n(x)$ are given by:

  $$
  x_k = \cos\left( \frac{2k - 1}{2n} \pi \right), \quad k = 1, 2, \dots, n
  $$

  The extrema (maximum and minimum points) of $T_n(x)$ occur at:

  $$
  x_k = \cos\left( \frac{k}{n} \pi \right), \quad k = 0, 1, \dots, n
  $$

## **Chebyshev Nodes**

Chebyshev nodes are specific points in the interval $[-1, 1]$ used as interpolation nodes to minimize the interpolation error.

### **Definition**

For $n+1$ Chebyshev nodes, the $k$-th node $x_k$ is given by:

$$
x_k = \cos\left( \frac{2k + 1}{2n + 2} \pi \right), \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n
$$

Alternatively, they can be expressed as:

$$
x_k = \cos\left( \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{2(n + 1)} \right), \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n
$$

### **Mapping to Arbitrary Intervals**

For an interval $[a, b]$, Chebyshev nodes are mapped as:

$$
x_k = \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{b - a}{2} \cos\left( \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{2(n + 1)} \right), \quad k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n
$$

### **Importance**

Using Chebyshev nodes instead of equally spaced nodes helps in minimizing the oscillatory behavior ([**Runge's phenomenon**](./runge-phenomenon.html)) and ensures better convergence properties of the interpolating polynomial.

## **Interpolation Process**

The Chebyshev Interpolation process involves the following steps:

1. **Select Chebyshev Nodes**: Determine the $n+1$ Chebyshev nodes $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_n$ in the interval $[-1, 1]$.

2. **Evaluate the Function**: Compute the function values $f(x_0), f(x_1), \dots, f(x_n)$.

3. **Construct the Interpolating Polynomial**: Use methods such as the Chebyshev series expansion or the barycentric interpolation formula to construct the interpolating polynomial $Q_n(x)$.

4. **Approximate the Function**: Use $Q_n(x)$ to approximate $f(x)$ within the interval.

### **Barycentric Interpolation Formula**

One efficient method to compute the interpolating polynomial is the barycentric interpolation formula:

$$
Q_n(x) = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{w_k f(x_k)}{x - x_k}}{\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{w_k}{x - x_k}}
$$

where $w_k$ are the barycentric weights defined as:

$$
w_k = (-1)^k \sin\left( \frac{(2k + 1)\pi}{2n + 2} \right)
$$

## **Advantages of Chebyshev Interpolation**

- **Minimized Error**: Chebyshev nodes minimize the maximum error (uniform convergence) of the interpolating polynomial.

- **Reduced Oscillations**: Avoids Runge's phenomenon, where high-degree polynomial interpolations at equally spaced nodes exhibit large oscillations near the interval endpoints.

- **Efficient Computation**: The barycentric interpolation formula allows for efficient and stable computation of interpolating polynomials.

- **Orthogonality**: Leveraging the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials aids in various approximation and numerical integration techniques.

## **Error Analysis**

Understanding the error associated with Chebyshev Interpolation is crucial for assessing the approximation's reliability.

### **Interpolation Error Formula**

For a function $f(x)$ sufficiently smooth on $[-1, 1]$, the error of the Chebyshev interpolating polynomial $Q_n(x)$ of degree $n$ is given by:

$$
|f(x) - Q_n(x)| \leq \frac{M}{(n+1)!} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}
$$

where:

- $M$ is an upper bound on the $(n+1)$-th derivative of $f(x)$ on $[-1, 1]$.

### **Worst-Case Error Estimate**

For example, if $f(x) = e^x$, all derivatives are $f^{(k)}(x) = e^x$. On $[-1, 1]$, $e^x \leq e$, so $M = e$.

For a fifth-degree polynomial ($n = 5$):

$$
|e^x - Q_5(x)| \leq \frac{e}{6!} \cdot \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{e}{720 \times 32} \approx 0.000118
$$

### **Implications**

An error bound of approximately $1.18 \times 10^{-4}$ implies that at least three decimal digits of the approximation $Q_5(x)$ are accurate across the interval $[-1, 1]$.

## **Example**

**Problem:** Approximate $f(x) = e^x$ on $[-1, 1]$ using a fifth-degree Chebyshev interpolating polynomial $Q_5(x)$. Estimate the worst-case error and determine the number of correct decimal digits in the approximation.

**Solution:**

1. **Determine $M$:**

   - $f^{(6)}(x) = e^x$, so $M = e$.

2. **Compute the Error Bound:**

   $$
   |e^x - Q_5(x)| \leq \frac{e}{6!} \cdot \frac{1}{2^5} = \frac{2.71828}{720 \times 32} \approx 0.000118
   $$

3. **Interpret the Error:**
   - The approximation $Q_5(x)$ deviates from $e^x$ by less than $1.18 \times 10^{-4}$.
   - **At least three decimal digits** of $Q_5(x)$ are accurate.

**Conclusion:** The fifth-degree Chebyshev interpolating polynomial $Q_5(x)$ approximates $e^x$ with an error less than $0.00012$, ensuring at least three correct decimal digits across $[-1, 1]$.

## **Applications**

Chebyshev Interpolation is widely used in various fields due to its robustness and efficiency:

- **Numerical Integration:** Chebyshev polynomials are used in Gaussian quadrature methods for approximating integrals.

- **Signal Processing:** Used in filter design and spectral analysis.

- **Computer Graphics:** Facilitates curve and surface modeling with minimal errors.

- **Scientific Computing:** Enhances the accuracy of simulations and numerical solutions to differential equations.

## **Conclusion**

Its mathematical foundations, combined with practical computational techniques, make it an essential tool in numerical analysis and various applied disciplines.
