## **Overview**

When solving nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations, we use **variation of parameters** to find a particular solution to the system. This approach is especially useful when dealing with systems where a simple guess for the particular solution is not possible due to the nature of the nonhomogeneous term.

## **Variation of Parameters**

Given a matrix $A$ of size $n \times n$ with constant entries, let $\Phi(t)$ be the **fundamental solution matrix** of the homogeneous system:

$$
\mathbf{x}' = A \mathbf{x}
$$

where $\mathbf{b}(t)$ is a continuous vector function. A particular solution $\mathbf{x}_p$ to the nonhomogeneous system:

$$
\mathbf{x}' = A \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{b}(t)
$$

is given by:

$$
\mathbf{x}_p(t) = \Phi(t) \int \Phi^{-1}(t) \mathbf{b}(t) \, dt
$$

This result is an application of the **method of variation of parameters** for nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations.

## **Explanation**

1. **Fundamental Solution Matrix** $\Phi(t)$: A matrix whose columns are linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous system $\mathbf{x}' = A \mathbf{x}$.
2. **Nonhomogeneous Term** $\mathbf{b}(t)$: This is the vector function that adds a nonhomogeneous component to the system.
3. **Particular Solution** $\mathbf{x}_p(t)$: This is the specific solution to the nonhomogeneous system, calculated using the formula above.

## **Formula Components**

- $\Phi(t)$: Fundamental solution matrix of the homogeneous system.
- $\Phi^{-1}(t)$: Inverse of the fundamental solution matrix.
- $\mathbf{b}(t)$: Nonhomogeneous term.
- Integral $\int \Phi^{-1}(t) \mathbf{b}(t) \, dt$: Computes the effect of the nonhomogeneous term over time, transformed by the inverse of $\Phi(t)$.

This approach allows us to find a particular solution $\mathbf{x}_p(t)$ by integrating the transformed nonhomogeneous term. The total solution to the system is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous system and this particular solution.

## **Summary**

The method of variation of parameters provides a systematic way to find a particular solution to nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations. By incorporating the fundamental solution matrix $\Phi(t)$, it enables us to account for the effects of the nonhomogeneous term $\mathbf{b}(t)$ and obtain a complete solution to the system.
