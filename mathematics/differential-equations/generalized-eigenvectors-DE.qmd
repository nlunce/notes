## **Overview**

When solving systems of differential equations, we use **eigenvectors** to
understand how the system evolves over time. Sometimes, however, we encounter a
repeated eigenvalue but don't have enough unique eigenvectors to fully describe
the solution. This is where **generalized eigenvectors** come into play.

## **Why Generalized Eigenvectors Are Needed**

1. **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues Recap**:

   - For a matrix $A$, an **eigenvalue** $\lambda$ represents a rate of growth
     or decay in the system.
   - An **eigenvector** $\mathbf{v}$ associated with $\lambda$ is a direction in
     which the system evolves according to $e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}$.

2. **The Problem with Repeated Eigenvalues**:

   - When an eigenvalue is repeated (e.g., $\lambda = 4$ with multiplicity 2),
     we typically need two linearly independent eigenvectors to capture all
     directions in the solution space.
   - If there’s only one eigenvector for a repeated eigenvalue, we can't span
     the entire space. This is where we turn to **generalized eigenvectors**.

3. **What a Generalized Eigenvector Does**:

   - A generalized eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_g$ helps fill in the missing
     direction when there's only one regular eigenvector.
   - Together, the eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ and generalized eigenvector
     $\mathbf{v}_g$ create a complete solution by introducing an extra component
     to the motion, such as $t e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}_g$.
   - This additional term allows the solution to "expand" over time, rather than
     being confined to a single line along $\mathbf{v}$.

## **How Generalized Eigenvectors Affect the Solution**

With a regular eigenvector $\mathbf{v}$ and generalized eigenvector
$\mathbf{v}_g$:

- The solution takes the form:

  $$
  \mathbf{x}(t) = c_1 e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v} + c_2 t e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}_g
  $$

- Here:

  - $e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}$: Moves along the direction of $\mathbf{v}$.
  - $t e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}_g$: Adds a "twist" or "shearing" motion that
    broadens the path, allowing the solution to explore the full space over
    time.

## **Visual Intuition**

1. **Eigenvector Only**:

   - Imagine the solution tracing a single line in the direction of
     $\mathbf{v}$, say along the x-axis. Without more directions, the solution
     can't expand in other directions.

2. **With Generalized Eigenvector**:

   - The term $t e^{\lambda t} \mathbf{v}_g$ introduces growth along a new
     direction, allowing the solution to move out of a single line. This gives a
     richer motion, often creating a "shearing" or "sweeping" effect in the
     plane.

## **Summary**

Generalized eigenvectors allow us to fully capture the behavior of systems with
repeated eigenvalues. They provide additional directions for the solution to
evolve, ensuring it spans all necessary dimensions and doesn’t collapse onto a
single line.
