## **Overview**

The **power series expansion** is a fundamental tool for representing functions as infinite sums. For the cosine function, this expansion provides an exact representation and a practical way to approximate $\cos(x)$ for any real value of $x$. The series is derived using the Taylor series centered at $x = 0$.

## **Power Series for Cosine**

The cosine function can be expressed as:

$$
\cos(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n}
$$

This series converges to the true value of $\cos(x)$ for all $x$. The first four terms of the series are:

$$
\cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!}
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
\cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} - \frac{x^6}{720}
$$

## **Explanation**

### **1. Taylor Series**

The power series for $\cos(x)$ is a special case of the Taylor series expansion about $x = 0$:

$$
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots
$$

For $\cos(x)$, the derivatives follow a cyclic pattern:

- $\cos(x)$
- $-\sin(x)$
- $-\cos(x)$
- $\sin(x)$

Evaluating these derivatives at $x = 0$:

- $\cos(0) = 1$
- $-\sin(0) = 0$
- $-\cos(0) = -1$
- $\sin(0) = 0$

Only the even derivatives contribute to the series.

### **2. General Term**

The general term of the series is:

$$
\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n)!} x^{2n}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer. This results in a series with only even powers of $x$, alternating in sign.

## **Examples**

1. **Small $x$:**  
   For $x = 0.1$, using the first four terms:

   $$
   \cos(0.1) \approx 1 - \frac{(0.1)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.1)^4}{24} - \frac{(0.1)^6}{720}
   $$

   This gives a close approximation to the true value of $\cos(0.1)$.

2. **Error Reduction:**  
   Adding more terms improves the approximation by reducing the truncation error.

## **Summary**

The power series expansion for $\cos(x)$ is an essential concept in calculus:

- **Exact Representation:** The series converges to $\cos(x)$ for all real $x$.
- **Approximation:** Truncated series provide practical approximations.
- **Applications:** Used in numerical analysis, signal processing, and physics.

The first four terms, $1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} - \frac{x^6}{720}$, often provide sufficient accuracy for small $x$. This compact yet precise representation highlights the elegance and utility of the power series.
