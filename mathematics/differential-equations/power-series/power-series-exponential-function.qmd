## **Overview**

The **power series expansion** for the exponential function $e^x$ is one of the most widely used series in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Derived from the Taylor series at $x = 0$, this expansion provides an exact representation of $e^x$ as an infinite sum.

## **Power Series for $e^x$**

The exponential function $e^x$ can be expressed as:

$$
e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

This series converges for all real $x$. The first four terms of the series are:

$$
e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!}
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
e^x \approx 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6}
$$

## **Explanation**

### **1. Taylor Series**

The power series for $e^x$ is derived from the Taylor series centered at $x = 0$:

$$
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots
$$

For $e^x$, all derivatives are $e^x$, and at $x = 0$:

$$
f(0) = e^0 = 1, \quad f'(0) = e^0 = 1, \quad f''(0) = e^0 = 1, \ldots-
$$

Thus, the coefficients of the Taylor series are $1/n!$.

### **2. General Term**

The general term of the series is:

$$
\frac{x^n}{n!}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer.

### **Key Property**

The series converges absolutely and uniformly for all $x$, making it highly reliable for approximations.

## **Examples**

1. **Small $x$:**  
   For $x = 0.1$, using the first four terms:

   $$
   e^{0.1} \approx 1 + 0.1 + \frac{(0.1)^2}{2} + \frac{(0.1)^3}{6}
   $$

   This provides a close approximation to $e^{0.1}$.

2. **Larger $x$:**  
   For $x = 1$, the first four terms give:

   $$
   e^1 \approx 1 + 1 + \frac{1^2}{2} + \frac{1^3}{6} = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.1667 \approx 2.6667
   $$

   Adding more terms improves the accuracy.

## **Summary**

The power series expansion for $e^x$ is a cornerstone in mathematics and science:

- **Exact Representation:** The infinite series converges to $e^x$ for all real $x$.
- **Approximation:** Truncated series provide practical approximations.
- **Applications:** Used in numerical analysis, differential equations, and growth modeling.

The first four terms, $1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{6}$, are often sufficient for small $x$. This series illustrates the utility of infinite sums in representing functions accurately and elegantly.
