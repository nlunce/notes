## **Overview**

The **power series expansion** for the sine function is another important result in calculus and analysis. Derived from the Taylor series at $x = 0$, it provides an exact representation of $\sin(x)$ as an infinite sum, allowing for precise approximations of its values.

## **Power Series for Sine**

The sine function can be expressed as:

$$
\sin(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1}
$$

This series converges to the true value of $\sin(x)$ for all $x$. The first four terms of the series are:

$$
\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!}
$$

which simplifies to:

$$
\sin(x) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \frac{x^7}{5040}
$$

## **Explanation**

### **1. Taylor Series**

The power series for $\sin(x)$ comes from the Taylor series expansion about $x = 0$:

$$
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \cdots
$$

For $\sin(x)$, the derivatives follow a cyclic pattern:

- $\sin(x)$
- $\cos(x)$
- $-\sin(x)$
- $-\cos(x)$

Evaluating these derivatives at $x = 0$:

- $\sin(0) = 0$
- $\cos(0) = 1$
- $-\sin(0) = 0$
- $-\cos(0) = -1$

Only the odd derivatives contribute to the series.

### **2. General Term**

The general term of the series is:

$$
\frac{(-1)^n}{(2n+1)!} x^{2n+1}
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer. This results in a series with only odd powers of $x$, alternating in sign.

## **Examples**

1. **Small $x$:**  
   For $x = 0.1$, using the first four terms:

   $$
   \sin(0.1) \approx 0.1 - \frac{(0.1)^3}{6} + \frac{(0.1)^5}{120} - \frac{(0.1)^7}{5040}
   $$

   This gives a close approximation to the true value of $\sin(0.1)$.

2. **Error Reduction:**  
   Adding more terms improves the approximation by reducing the truncation error.

## **Summary**

The power series expansion for $\sin(x)$ is a cornerstone in mathematics:

- **Exact Representation:** The infinite series converges to $\sin(x)$ for all real $x$.
- **Approximation:** Truncated series provide practical approximations.
- **Applications:** Used in numerical analysis, physics, and solving differential equations.

The first four terms, $x - \frac{x^3}{6} + \frac{x^5}{120} - \frac{x^7}{5040}$, often provide sufficient accuracy for small $x$. This series highlights the utility and elegance of representing functions as infinite sums.
