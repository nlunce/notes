## **Overview**

The **power series expansion** for $\frac{1}{1-x}$ is a classic example of a geometric series. It provides a representation of the function as an infinite sum of powers of $x$, valid for $|x| < 1$. This series is particularly useful in algebra and calculus.

## **Power Series for $\frac{1}{1-x}$**

The function $\frac{1}{1-x}$ can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
$$

This series converges for $|x| < 1$. The first four terms of the series are:

$$
\frac{1}{1-x} \approx 1 + x + x^2 + x^3
$$

## **Explanation**

### **1. Geometric Series**

The series arises from the infinite geometric series:

$$
\sum_{n=0}^\infty r^n = \frac{1}{1-r}, \quad \text{for } |r| < 1
$$

In this case, substituting $r = x$, we get:

$$
\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
$$

### **2. General Term**

The general term of the series is:

$$
x^n
$$

where $n$ is a non-negative integer. This leads to a simple and elegant representation.

### **3. Radius of Convergence**

The series converges only for $|x| < 1$, as the geometric series formula is valid within this interval. For $|x| \geq 1$, the series does not converge.

## **Examples**

1. **Small $x$:**  
   For $x = 0.1$, using the first four terms:

   $$
   \frac{1}{1-0.1} \approx 1 + 0.1 + (0.1)^2 + (0.1)^3 = 1 + 0.1 + 0.01 + 0.001 = 1.111
   $$

   This is close to the exact value $\frac{1}{0.9} = 1.111\ldots$.

2. **Larger $x$:**  
   For $x = 0.5$, the first four terms give:

   $$
   \frac{1}{1-0.5} \approx 1 + 0.5 + (0.5)^2 + (0.5)^3 = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125 = 1.875
   $$

   Adding more terms increases the accuracy.

## **Summary**

The power series expansion for $\frac{1}{1-x}$ is a simple yet powerful tool in analysis:

- **Exact Representation:** The infinite series converges to $\frac{1}{1-x}$ for $|x| < 1$.
- **Approximation:** Truncated series provide practical approximations for $|x| < 1$.
- **Applications:** Used in algebra, calculus, and as the foundation for many other series expansions.

The first four terms, $1 + x + x^2 + x^3$, offer a quick approximation for small $x$. This series demonstrates the elegance of geometric progressions in representing functions.
