## **Overview**

A function $f(t)$ is said to be of **exponential order** if its growth is controlled by an exponential function $e^{\alpha t}$ as $t$ becomes large. This concept is crucial for ensuring the applicability of certain mathematical operations, such as the Laplace Transform, and for understanding the long-term behavior of functions.

In simpler terms:

- **Exponential Order**: $f(t)$ does not grow too quickly.
- **"Too Fast"**: The growth of $f(t)$ is slower than or comparable to $e^{\alpha t}$ for some fixed $\alpha$.

## **Definition**

Formally, a function $f(t)$ is of **exponential order** $\alpha$ if there exist constants $M > 0$ and $t_0 \geq 0$ such that:

$$
|f(t)| \leq M e^{\alpha t}, \quad \text{for all } t \geq t_0
$$

### **Key Components:**

1. **Bounded Growth**: For $t \geq t_0$, the magnitude of $f(t)$ does not exceed $M e^{\alpha t}$.
2. **Constants**:
   - $M$: A positive constant that bounds $f(t)$.
   - $\alpha$: The exponential growth rate that controls the bound.
   - $t_0$: The threshold after which the bound holds.

This definition ensures that $f(t)$ does not grow faster than $e^{\alpha t}$ for sufficiently large $t$.

## **Understanding "Too Fast" Growth**

When we describe a function as growing "too fast" to be of exponential order, we mean that it **outpaces** the growth of any exponential function $e^{\alpha t}$, regardless of how large $\alpha$ is chosen. For instance, functions like $e^{t^2}$ grow so rapidly that no exponential bound $e^{\alpha t}$ can contain them for all large $t$.

### **Intuition:**

1. **Exponential Functions**: $e^{\alpha t}$ grow rapidly, but many functions (e.g., polynomials) grow slower or at a similar rate for large $t$.
2. **Super-Exponential Functions**: Functions like $e^{t^2}$ grow faster than any $e^{\alpha t}$ because the exponent itself grows faster (e.g., $t^2$ vs. $\alpha t$).

If a function grows faster than $e^{\alpha t}$, it cannot be bounded by any exponential function, and thus, it is **not** of exponential order.

### **Example: Comparing $e^{t^2}$ and $e^{\alpha t}$**

Consider $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ and $g(t) = e^{\alpha t}$ with $\alpha = 2$.

1. **At $t = 1$**:

   $$
   e^{t^2} = e^1 \approx 2.718, \quad e^{\alpha t} = e^2 \approx 7.389
   $$

   Here, $e^{t^2} < e^{\alpha t}$.

2. **At $t = 2$**:

   $$
   e^{t^2} = e^4 \approx 54.598, \quad e^{\alpha t} = e^4 \approx 54.598
   $$

   Now, $e^{t^2} = e^{\alpha t}$.

3. **At $t = 3$**:
   $$
   e^{t^2} = e^9 \approx 8103, \quad e^{\alpha t} = e^6 \approx 403
   $$
   Here, $e^{t^2} > e^{\alpha t}$.

As $t \to \infty$, $e^{t^2}$ grows much faster than $e^{\alpha t}$, no matter how large $\alpha$ is. This demonstrates that $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ is **not** of exponential order.

## **Example 1: Polynomial Function $f(t) = t^2$**

Let's determine if $f(t) = t^2$ is of exponential order.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Growth of $f(t)$**

The function $f(t) = t^2$ grows quadratically as $t \to \infty$. In contrast, an exponential function like $e^{\alpha t}$ grows much faster for large $t$. This suggests that $t^2$ might be bounded by $e^{\alpha t}$ for some $\alpha > 0$.

### **Step 2: Choose $\alpha$ and $M$**

- **Select $\alpha = 1$**: A reasonable starting point for the exponential growth rate.
- **Determine $M$**: We aim to find $M$ such that $t^2 \leq M e^t$ for all $t \geq t_0$.

### **Step 3: Verify the Bound**

- **At $t = 3$**:

  $$
  t^2 = 9, \quad e^t \approx 20.09
  $$

  Clearly, $t^2 \leq e^t$.

- **As $t$ increases**: $e^t$ grows significantly faster than $t^2$, ensuring that $t^2 \leq M e^t$ for some $M > 0$.

**Conclusion**: For $t \geq t_0 = 3$, we can choose $M = 1$ and $\alpha = 1$ to satisfy:

$$
|f(t)| \leq M e^{\alpha t}
$$

Therefore, $f(t) = t^2$ is of exponential order with $\alpha = 1$.

## **Example 2: Exponential Function $f(t) = e^{t^2}$**

Now, let's examine whether $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ is of exponential order.

### **Step 1: Analyze the Growth of $f(t)$**

The function $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ grows much faster than any exponential function $e^{\alpha t}$ as $t \to \infty$.

### **Step 2: Attempt to Establish the Bound**

Assume, for contradiction, that $e^{t^2} \leq M e^{\alpha t}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

$$
t^2 \leq \ln(M) + \alpha t
$$

For large $t$, the left side ($t^2$) grows faster than the right side ($\ln(M) + \alpha t$), making the inequality impossible to satisfy.

### **Conclusion**

No constants $M > 0$ and $\alpha > 0$ can ensure $|f(t)| \leq M e^{\alpha t}$ for all sufficiently large $t$. Therefore, $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ is **not** of exponential order.

## **Why Use Exponential Bounds?**

Exponential functions $e^{\alpha t}$ serve as a benchmark for measuring the **rate of growth** of other functions:

- **Controlled Growth**: If a function grows slower than or at the same rate as $e^{\alpha t}$, its growth is considered manageable, making it suitable for operations like the Laplace Transform.
- **Uncontrolled Growth**: If a function grows faster than $e^{\alpha t}$, its growth becomes unmanageable, rendering it unsuitable for certain mathematical techniques.

### **Summary:**

- **Functions Growing "Too Fast"**: These **outpace** exponential functions $e^{\alpha t}$ and are **not** of exponential order.
- **Functions of Exponential Order**: These grow **slower than or similarly to** $e^{\alpha t}$, ensuring their growth is under control.

Understanding whether a function is of exponential order is essential for determining the applicability of various mathematical tools and for analyzing the function's long-term behavior.
