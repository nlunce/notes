## **Overview**

The **First Derivative Property of the Laplace Transform** relates the Laplace transform of a derivative $f'(t)$ to the transform of $f(t)$ and its initial value. The property states:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - f(0)
$$

This theorem is widely used in solving differential equations with given initial conditions.

## **Proof**

### **Write the Laplace Transform of the Derivative**

By definition, the Laplace transform of $f'(t)$ is:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = \int_0^\infty f'(t) e^{-st} \, dt
$$

### **Apply Integration by Parts**

The integration by parts formula is given by:

$$
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
$$

Let:

- $u = e^{-st}$ and $dv = f'(t) dt$,
- Then $du = -s e^{-st} dt$ and $v = f(t)$.

Using this formula:

$$
\int_0^\infty f'(t) e^{-st} \, dt = \left[ f(t) e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty - \int_0^\infty f(t)(-s e^{-st}) \, dt
$$

### **Evaluate the Boundary Terms**

1. At $t = \infty$, $f(t) e^{-st} \to 0$, assuming $f(t)$ grows no faster than an exponential function.
2. At $t = 0$, $f(t) e^{-s(0)} = f(0)$.

Thus, the boundary term becomes:

$$
\left[ f(t) e^{-st} \right]_0^\infty = -f(0)
$$

### **Simplify the Remaining Integral**

The remaining integral is:

$$
\int_0^\infty s f(t) e^{-st} \, dt = s \int_0^\infty f(t) e^{-st} \, dt
$$

By definition, this is:

$$
s \mathcal{L}[f(t)]
$$

### **Combine Results**

Substituting the results back into the equation:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = -f(0) + s \mathcal{L}[f(t)]
$$

Rearranging:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - f(0)
$$

### **Conclusion**

The proof demonstrates that:

$$
\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - f(0)
$$

## **Corollary: Laplace Transform of $g'(t) = f''(t)$**

To extend the property to $g'(t) = f''(t)$:

1. Define $g(t) = f'(t)$. Then the Laplace transform of $g'(t) = f''(t)$ is:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = \mathcal{L}[g'(t)]
   $$

2. Using the First Derivative Property for $g(t)$:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[g'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[g(t)] - g(0)
   $$

   Substituting $g(t) = f'(t)$ and $g(0) = f'(0)$:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[f'(t)] - f'(0)
   $$

3. Substitute the First Derivative Property for $f'(t)$:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f'(t)] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - f(0)
   $$

   Substituting into the equation:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = s \big(s\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - f(0)\big) - f'(0)
   $$

4. Simplify the expression:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = s^2\mathcal{L}[f(t)] - sf(0) - f'(0)
   $$

### **Example Application**

For $f(t) = t^2$, with $f'(t) = 2t$, $f''(t) = 2$, and $f(0) = 0$, $f'(0) = 0$:

1. Compute $\mathcal{L}[f(t)] = \frac{2}{s^3}$.
2. Using the corollary:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = s^2 \cdot \frac{2}{s^3} - s \cdot 0 - 0
   $$

   Simplify:

   $$
   \mathcal{L}[f''(t)] = \frac{2s^2}{s^3} = \frac{2}{s}
   $$

## **Summary**

The **First Derivative Property** establishes a relationship between the Laplace transform of $f'(t)$ and the transform of $f(t)$. The corollary extends this result to include the second derivative, $f''(t) = g'(t)$, where $g(t) = f'(t)$. These properties are essential for solving second-order differential equations with specified initial conditions.
