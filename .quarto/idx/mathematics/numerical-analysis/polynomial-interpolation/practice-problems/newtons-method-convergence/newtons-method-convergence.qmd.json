This value is slightly larger than $S$, but still less than one. If $x_i$ lies within this neighborhood, then $c_i$, being between $x_i$ and $r$, also lies within this neighborhood.

Explain why:**\n\nDividing both sides by $e_i^2$ and taking the limit as $i \\to \\infty$ will complete the proof. However, evaluating the limit on the right-hand side requires some care. Justify each of the following steps in this process:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right|\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nTo solve the limit\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right|\n$$\n\nproceed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right| = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{|f''(c_i)|}{|2f'(x_i)|}\n$$\n\nThis works because the absolute value of a fraction is equal to the fraction of the absolute values.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{|f''(c_i)|}{|2f'(x_i)|} = \\frac{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)|}{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)|}\n$$\n\nThis step follows from the property of limits that allows the limit of a fraction to be written as the fraction of the limits, provided the limits of both the numerator and denominator exist and the denominator does not approach zero.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)| = |f''(r)|\n$$\n\nThe point $c_i$ approaches $r$ as $i \\to \\infty$ because $c_i$ is always between $x_i$ and $r$, and Newton's Method ensures $x_i \\to r$, causing the interval $(x_i, r)$ to shrink to a single point, while the continuity of $f''(x)$ guarantees $f''(c_i) \\to f''(r)$.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)| = 2|f'(r)|\n$$\n\nThis is valid because as $i \\to \\infty$, $x_i \\to r$, and $f'(x_i)$ is continuous. The factor of $2$ in the denominator is a constant, so it remains unchanged during the limit process.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)|}{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)|} = \\left|\\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}\\right|\n$$\n\nThus, the solution to the limit is:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\left|\\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}\\right|\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof by showing that the error $e_{i+1}$ at each step decreases quadratically in relation to the square of the error $e_i$ at the previous step, demonstrating the **quadratic convergence** of Newton's Method.\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":true,"code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":{"source":false,"toggle":true,"caption":"See
