For instance, functions like $e^{t^2}$ grow so rapidly that no exponential bound $e^{\\alpha t}$ can contain them for all large $t$.\n\n### **Intuition:**\n\n1. **Exponential Functions**: $e^{\\alpha t}$ grow rapidly, but many functions (e.g., polynomials) grow slower or at a similar rate for large $t$.\n2. **Super-Exponential Functions**: Functions like $e^{t^2}$ grow faster than any $e^{\\alpha t}$ because the exponent itself grows faster (e.g., $t^2$ vs. $\\alpha t$).\n\nIf a function grows faster than $e^{\\alpha t}$, it cannot be bounded by any exponential function, and thus, it is **not** of exponential order.\n\n### **Example: Comparing $e^{t^2}$ and $e^{\\alpha t}$**\n\nConsider $f(t) = e^{t^2}$ and $g(t) = e^{\\alpha t}$ with $\\alpha = 2$.\n\n1. **At $t = 1$**:\n\n   $$\n   e^{t^2} = e^1 \\approx 2.718, \\quad e^{\\alpha t} = e^2 \\approx 7.389\n   $$\n\n   Here, $e^{t^2} < e^{\\alpha t}$.\n\n2. **At $t = 2$**:\n\n   $$\n   e^{t^2} = e^4 \\approx 54.598, \\quad e^{\\alpha t} = e^4 \\approx 54.598\n   $$\n\n   Now, $e^{t^2} = e^{\\alpha t}$.\n\n3. **At $t = 3$**:\n   $$\n   e^{t^2} = e^9 \\approx 8103, \\quad e^{\\alpha t} = e^6 \\approx 403\n   $$\n   Here, $e^{t^2} > e^{\\alpha t}$.\n\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, $e^{t^2}$ grows much faster than $e^{\\alpha t}$, no matter how large $\\alpha$ is.
