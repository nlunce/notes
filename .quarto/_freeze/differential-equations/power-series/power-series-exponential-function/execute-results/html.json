Derived from the Taylor series at $x = 0$, this expansion provides an exact representation of $e^x$ as an infinite sum.\n\n## **Power Series for $e^x$**\n\nThe exponential function $e^x$ can be expressed as:\n\n$$\ne^x = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{x^n}{n!}\n$$\n\nThis series converges for all real $x$. The first four terms of the series are:\n\n$$\ne^x \\approx 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^3}{3!}\n$$\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n$$\ne^x \\approx 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6}\n$$\n\n## **Explanation**\n\n### **1. Taylor Series**\n\nThe power series for $e^x$ is derived from the Taylor series centered at $x = 0$:\n\n$$\nf(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + \\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2 + \\frac{f^{(3)}(0)}{3!}x^3 + \\cdots\n$$\n\nFor $e^x$, all derivatives are $e^x$, and at $x = 0$:\n\n$$\nf(0) = e^0 = 1, \\quad f'(0) = e^0 = 1, \\quad f''(0) = e^0 = 1, \\ldots-\n$$\n\nThus, the coefficients of the Taylor series are $1/n!$.\n\n### **2. General Term**\n\nThe general term of the series is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^n}{n!}\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is a non-negative integer.\n\n### **Key Property**\n\nThe series converges absolutely and uniformly for all $x$, making it highly reliable for approximations.\n\n## **Examples**\n\n1. **Small $x$:**  \n   For $x = 0.1$, using the first four terms:\n\n   $$\n   e^{0.1} \\approx 1 + 0.1 + \\frac{(0.1)^2}{2} + \\frac{(0.1)^3}{6}\n   $$\n\n   This provides a close approximation to $e^{0.1}$.\n\n2. **Larger $x$:**  \n   For $x = 1$, the first four terms give:\n\n   $$\n   e^1 \\approx 1 + 1 + \\frac{1^2}{2} + \\frac{1^3}{6} = 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.1667 \\approx 2.6667\n   $$\n\n   Adding more terms improves the accuracy.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThe power series expansion for $e^x$ is a cornerstone in mathematics and science:\n\n- **Exact Representation:** The infinite series converges to $e^x$ for all real $x$.\n- **Approximation:** Truncated series provide practical approximations.\n- **Applications:** Used in numerical analysis, differential equations, and growth modeling.\n\nThe first four terms, $1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6}$, are often sufficient for small $x$. This series illustrates the utility of infinite sums in representing functions accurately and elegantly.\n\n",
