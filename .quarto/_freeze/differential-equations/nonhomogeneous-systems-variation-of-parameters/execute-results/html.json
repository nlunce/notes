This approach is especially useful when dealing with systems where a simple guess for the particular solution is not possible due to the nature of the nonhomogeneous term.\n\n## **Variation of Parameters**\n\nGiven a matrix $A$ of size $n \\times n$ with constant entries, let $\\Phi(t)$ be the **fundamental solution matrix** of the homogeneous system:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = A \\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{b}(t)$ is a continuous vector function. A particular solution $\\mathbf{x}_p$ to the nonhomogeneous system:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}' = A \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b}(t)\n$$\n\nis given by:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_p(t) = \\Phi(t) \\int \\Phi^{-1}(t) \\mathbf{b}(t) \\, dt\n$$\n\nThis result is an application of the **method of variation of parameters** for nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations.\n\n## **Explanation**\n\n1. **Fundamental Solution Matrix** $\\Phi(t)$: A matrix whose columns are linearly independent solutions to the homogeneous system $\\mathbf{x}' = A \\mathbf{x}$.\n2. **Nonhomogeneous Term** $\\mathbf{b}(t)$: This is the vector function that adds a nonhomogeneous component to the system.\n3. **Particular Solution** $\\mathbf{x}_p(t)$: This is the specific solution to the nonhomogeneous system, calculated using the formula above.\n\n## **Formula Components**\n\n- $\\Phi(t)$: Fundamental solution matrix of the homogeneous system.\n- $\\Phi^{-1}(t)$: Inverse of the fundamental solution matrix.\n- $\\mathbf{b}(t)$: Nonhomogeneous term.\n- Integral $\\int \\Phi^{-1}(t) \\mathbf{b}(t) \\, dt$: Computes the effect of the nonhomogeneous term over time, transformed by the inverse of $\\Phi(t)$.\n\nThis approach allows us to find a particular solution $\\mathbf{x}_p(t)$ by integrating the transformed nonhomogeneous term. The total solution to the system is the sum of the general solution to the homogeneous system and this particular solution.\n\n## **Summary**\n\nThe method of variation of parameters provides a systematic way to find a particular solution to nonhomogeneous systems of differential equations. By incorporating the fundamental solution matrix $\\Phi(t)$, it enables us to account for the effects of the nonhomogeneous term $\\mathbf{b}(t)$ and obtain a complete solution to the system.\n\n",
