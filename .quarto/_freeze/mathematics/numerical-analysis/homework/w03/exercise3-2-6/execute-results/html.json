However, constructing a polynomial of degree exactly 5 requires a different approach.\n\n### **Key Concepts**\n\n1. **Theorem 3.2** (Main Theorem of Polynomial Interpolation) guarantees that a unique polynomial of degree $n-1$ exists for $n$ distinct points.\n2. To create a polynomial of degree 5 when you only have 4 points, you need to add an **extra term** that still passes through all the original points but elevates the polynomial’s degree.\n\n## **Solution:**\n\nTo create a degree 5 polynomial that still passes through all four points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(4, 4)$, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Find the degree 3 polynomial $P_3(x)$:**\n\n   - Use either **Newton’s divided differences** or **Lagrange interpolation** to find the polynomial of degree 3 that passes through the given points. Let’s call this polynomial $P_3(x)$.\n\n2. **Add a higher-degree term:**\n   - To turn this degree 3 polynomial into a degree 5 polynomial, we add a term that evaluates to zero at the given points:\n\n$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$\n\n- The new term $(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$ is zero at $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, so it won’t affect the interpolation at those points. By multiplying this term by a constant $c$, we ensure that the degree of the polynomial is elevated to 5, but the polynomial still interpolates the original points.\n\n### **Final Degree 5 Polynomial**\n\nThus, the degree 5 polynomial is given by:\n\n$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$\n\n- $P_3(x)$ is the degree 3 polynomial found using standard interpolation methods.\n- $c$ is an arbitrary constant that determines the shape of the polynomial outside the interpolation points.\n\n### **Example**\n\nLet’s assume the degree 3 polynomial $P_3(x)$ through the points $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 4)$ is:\n\n$$P_3(x) = 1 + 2(x - 1) + 3(x - 1)(x - 2)$$\n\nThen the degree 5 polynomial becomes:\n\n$$P_5(x) = P_3(x) + c(x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 3)(x - 4)$$\n\n### **Does the Value of $c$ Matter?**\n\nNo, the value of $c$ does not affect the interpolation at the given points. Since the additional term evaluates to 0 at $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$, the polynomial will still pass through the points, regardless of $c$.\n\nHowever, changing $c$ affects the behavior of the polynomial **outside** the interpolation points. For different values of $c$, the polynomial will look different beyond the four points, but it will still pass through $(1, 1)$, $(2, 3) $, $ (3, 3) $, and $ (4, 4)$.\n\n",
