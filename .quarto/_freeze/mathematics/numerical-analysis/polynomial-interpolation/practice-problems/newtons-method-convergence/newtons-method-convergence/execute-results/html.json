Under these conditions, Fixed-Point Iteration converges linearly with rate $S$ to the fixed point $r$ for initial guesses sufficiently close to $r$.\n\n### **Proof**\n\nLet $x_i$ represent the $i$-th iteration. By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists some $c_i$ between $x_i$ and $r$ such that:\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} - r = g'(c_i)(x_i - r)\n$$\n\nHere, we substitute $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$ and $r = g(r)$. Defining the error $e_i = |x_i - r|$, this equation can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = |g'(c_i)|e_i\n$$\n\nIf $S = |g'(r)|$ is less than one, the continuity of $g'$ ensures that there exists a small neighborhood around $r$ where $|g'(x)| < (S + 1)/2$. This value is slightly larger than $S$, but still less than one. If $x_i$ lies within this neighborhood, then $c_i$, being between $x_i$ and $r$, also lies within this neighborhood. Consequently:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} \\leq \\frac{S + 1}{2} e_i\n$$\n\nThis inequality shows that the error decreases by at least a factor of $(S + 1)/2$ on this and every subsequent step. As a result, $\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} x_i = r$. Furthermore, taking the limit of the ratio of consecutive errors yields:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i} = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |g'(c_i)| = |g'(r)| = S\n$$\n\nThis establishes that the iteration converges linearly with rate $S$.\n\n## **Newton's Method Convergence Theorem**\n\n_Theorem 1.11 (p. 53)_\n\nLet $f$ be twice continuously differentiable and $f(r) = 0$. If $f'(r) \\neq 0$, then Newton’s Method is locally and quadratically convergent to $r$. The error $e_i$ at step $i$ satisfies:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = M\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nM = \\left| \\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \\right|\n$$\n\n## **Proof**\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## **1. Show $g'(r) = 0$:**\n\nNewton’s Method is\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} = x_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}\n$$\n\nThis has the form of Fixed-Point Iteration (i.e., $x_{i+1} = g(x_i)$), where\n\n$$\ng(x) = x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\n$$\n\nShow that $g'(r) = 0$.\n\nWhat does this imply about the convergence of Newton’s Method? _(Hint: see Theorem 1.6)_\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nNewton’s Method is given by the iteration formula:\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} = x_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}\n$$\n\nThis can be expressed in the form of Fixed-Point Iteration by defining:\n\n$$\ng(x) = x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)}\n$$\n\nTherefore, the iteration becomes:\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} = g(x_i)\n$$\n\nTo find $g'(r)$, first differentiate $g(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n\n$$\ng'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( x - \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \\right)\n$$\n\nUsing the **Quotient Rule** for differentiation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{f(x)}{f'(x)} \\right) = \\frac{f'(x)f'(x) - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = \\frac{[f'(x)]^2 - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2}\n$$\n\nSubstituting back into the expression for $g'(x)$:\n\n$$\ng'(x) = 1 - \\frac{[f'(x)]^2 - f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = 1 - 1 + \\frac{f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2} = \\frac{f(x)f''(x)}{[f'(x)]^2}\n$$\n\nGiven that $r$ is the root of $f(x)$:\n\n$$\nf(r) = 0\n$$\n\nPlugging $x = r$ into the derivative:\n\n$$\ng'(r) = \\frac{f(r)f''(r)}{[f'(r)]^2} = \\frac{0 \\cdot f''(r)}{[f'(r)]^2} = 0\n$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$\ng'(r) = 0\n$$\n\n**This implies that convergence is guaranteed locally:**\n\n_Theorem 1.6_ states that if $|g'(r)| < 1$, the Fixed-Point Iteration will converge to $r$, provided the initial guess $x_0$ is sufficiently close to $r$. Since $g'(r) = 0$, this condition is satisfied with $|g'(r)| = 0 < 1$. Thus, Newton’s Method will converge to the root $r$ if the initial guess is close enough.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## **2. First two terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$:**\n\nTo complete our proof, we need to show that\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\left| \\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)} \\right|\n$$\n\nBegin by writing out the first **two** terms of the Taylor series for $f(r)$ centered at $x_i$, along with the remainder term (see p. 21, with $x = r$, $x_0 = x_i$, and $c = c_i$).\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nThe Taylor series expansion of a function $f(x)$ around a point $x_i$ up to the second term is given by:\n\n$$\nf(r) = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nHere:\n\n- $x_i$ is the current approximation.\n- $c_i$ is a point between $x_i$ and $r$.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## **3. Manipulate result:**\n\nManipulate your result so it looks like this _(note: the LHS of this equation is the RHS of Newton’s Method)_:\n\n$$\nx_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nIn order for these expressions to be defined, we must have $f'(x_i) \\neq 0$. By assumption, we have $f'(r) \\neq 0$. What allows us to conclude that the same is true for $f'(x_i)$?\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nFrom the Taylor series expansion of $f(r)$ centered at $x_i$, we have:\n\n$$\nf(r) = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nSince $r$ is the root of $f(x)$, $f(r) = 0$. Substitute $f(r) = 0$:\n\n$$\n0 = f(x_i) + f'(x_i)(r - x_i) + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nRearrange to solve for $f(x_i)$:\n\n$$\nf(x_i) = -f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nThe formula for Newton’s Method is:\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} = x_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}\n$$\n\nSubstitute $f(x_i) = -f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2$ into $x_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)}$:\n\n$$\nx_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = x_i - \\frac{-f'(x_i)(r - x_i) - \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2}{f'(x_i)}\n$$\n\nBreak this into two terms:\n\n- The first term:\n\n  $$\n  -\\frac{-f'(x_i)(r - x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r - x_i\n  $$\n\n- The second term:\n  $$\n  -\\frac{\\frac{f''(c_i)}{2}(r - x_i)^2}{f'(x_i)} = \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2\n  $$\n\nCombine the terms:\n\n$$\nx_i - \\frac{f(x_i)}{f'(x_i)} = r + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\n**As the index $i \\to \\infty$, $x_i \\to r$. Since $f'(x)$ is continuous and $f'(r) \\neq 0$, it follows that $f'(x_i) \\neq 0$ for all sufficiently large $i$.**\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## **4. Combine results:**\n\nLet $e_i = |r - x_i|$ (so $e_{i+1} = |r - x_{i+1}|$). Use these together with the definition of Newton’s method in step (1) and your result from step (3) to obtain:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right| e_i^2\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nStart with the error definition at step $i+1$:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = |r - x_{i+1}|\n$$\n\nFrom the earlier derived formula for $x_{i+1}$, we have:\n\n$$\nx_{i+1} = r + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2\n$$\n\nSubstituting this into the error formula:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = |r - (r + \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2)|\n$$\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = |\\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)}(r - x_i)^2|\n$$\n\nUsing the definition of $e_i = |r - x_i|$, substitute $e_i$ for $|r - x_i|$:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right| e_i^2\n$$\n\nThis matches the desired formula:\n\n$$\ne_{i+1} = \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right| e_i^2\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note icon=false}\n\n## **5. Explain why:**\n\nDividing both sides by $e_i^2$ and taking the limit as $i \\to \\infty$ will complete the proof. However, evaluating the limit on the right-hand side requires some care. Justify each of the following steps in this process:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right|\n$$\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n\n## **Answer**\n\nTo solve the limit\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right|\n$$\n\nproceed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\left| \\frac{f''(c_i)}{2f'(x_i)} \\right| = \\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{|f''(c_i)|}{|2f'(x_i)|}\n$$\n\nThis works because the absolute value of a fraction is equal to the fraction of the absolute values.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{|f''(c_i)|}{|2f'(x_i)|} = \\frac{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)|}{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)|}\n$$\n\nThis step follows from the property of limits that allows the limit of a fraction to be written as the fraction of the limits, provided the limits of both the numerator and denominator exist and the denominator does not approach zero.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)| = |f''(r)|\n$$\n\nThe point $c_i$ approaches $r$ as $i \\to \\infty$ because $c_i$ is always between $x_i$ and $r$, and Newton's Method ensures $x_i \\to r$, causing the interval $(x_i, r)$ to shrink to a single point, while the continuity of $f''(x)$ guarantees $f''(c_i) \\to f''(r)$.\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)| = 2|f'(r)|\n$$\n\nThis is valid because as $i \\to \\infty$, $x_i \\to r$, and $f'(x_i)$ is continuous. The factor of $2$ in the denominator is a constant, so it remains unchanged during the limit process.\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |f''(c_i)|}{\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} |2f'(x_i)|} = \\left|\\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}\\right|\n$$\n\nThus, the solution to the limit is:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{i \\to \\infty} \\frac{e_{i+1}}{e_i^2} = \\left|\\frac{f''(r)}{2f'(r)}\\right|\n$$\n\nThis completes the proof by showing that the error $e_{i+1}$ at each step decreases quadratically in relation to the square of the error $e_i$ at the previous step, demonstrating the **quadratic convergence** of Newton's Method.\n:::\n\n",
