These solutions represent the numbers that, when multiplied by themselves $n$ times, equal 1.\n\n## **Roots of Unity in Real Numbers**\n\n### **What Are They?**\n\nIn the real numbers, the equation $z^n = 1$ has at most two solutions:\n\n1. $z = 1$ (the trivial solution).\n2. $z = -1$, but only when $n$ is even.\n\n### **Primitive Roots in Real Numbers**\n\nPrimitive roots of unity are roots that **generate all roots of unity through their powers**. In the real numbers:\n\n- $z = 1$: Trivial root, but it cannot generate anything else. Not primitive.\n- $z = -1$: Primitive for even $n$, as it alternates between $1$ and $-1$.\n\nThus, in the real numbers:\n\n- For $n = 2$, the primitive root is $-1$.\n- For $n > 2$, there are no new primitive roots in the reals.\n\nThis limitation motivates expanding the idea to the **complex plane**.\n\n## **Extending Roots of Unity to the Complex Plane**\n\n### **Complex Roots of Unity**\n\nTo find all solutions to $z^n = 1$ in the complex plane, we use **Euler’s formula**:\n\n$$\nz = e^{i \\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle (in radians) of $z$ on the unit circle in the complex plane. The general solution to $z^n = 1$ is:\n\n$$\nz_k = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi k}{n}}, \\quad k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1\n$$\n\nThese solutions are the **$n$-th roots of unity**. They are equally spaced points on the unit circle, with angles:\n\n$$\n\\theta_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\n$$\n\n### **Example: 4th Roots of Unity ($n = 4$)**\n\nFor $z^4 = 1$, the roots are:\n\n1. $z_0 = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0}{4}} = e^{i 0} = 1$\n2. $z_1 = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 1}{4}} = e^{i \\frac{\\pi}{2}} = i$\n3. $z_2 = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 2}{4}} = e^{i \\pi} = -1$\n4. $z_3 = e^{i \\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 3}{4}} = e^{i \\frac{3\\pi}{2}} = -i$\n\nThese roots are $\\{1, i, -1, -i\\}$, representing four equally spaced points on the unit circle.\n\n## **Primitive Roots of Unity**\n\n### **What Makes a Root Primitive?**\n\nA root of unity $z$ is **primitive** if it generates all $n$-th roots of unity through its successive powers.\n\nFormally:\n\n- $z$ is primitive if $z^k \\neq 1$ for $1 \\leq k < n$, and $z^n = 1$\n\n### **Example: Primitive Roots for $n = 4$**\n\nThe 4th roots of unity are $\\{1, i, -1, -i\\}$. Let’s test each root:\n\n1. $z = 1$: $1^k = 1$ for all $k$. Not primitive.\n2. $z = i$:\n   - $i^1 = i$\n   - $i^2 = -1$\n   - $i^3 = -i$\n   - $i^4 = 1$ (cycles through all roots) **Primitive**\n3. $z = -1$:\n   - $(-1)^1 = -1$,\n   - $(-1)^2 = 1$ (only alternates between $-1$ and $1$). Not primitive.\n4. $z = -i$:\n   - $(-i)^1 = -i$\n   - $(-i)^2 = -1$\n   - $(-i)^3 = i$\n   - $(-i)^4 = 1$ **Primitive**\n\nThus, the primitive roots for $n = 4$ are $i$ and $-i$.\n\n## **Visualizing Roots of Unity**\n\nRoots of unity lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, evenly spaced at angles $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$. For $n = 4$:\n\n- $z_0 = 1$ at $0^\\circ$\n- $z_1 = i$ at $90^\\circ$\n- $z_2 = -1$ at $180^\\circ$\n- $z_3 = -i$ at $270^\\circ$\n\nPrimitive roots, like $i$, act as the \"generator,\" visiting each point exactly once when raised to successive powers.\n\n## **Applications of Roots of Unity**\n\n1. **In Algebra**:  \n   Roots of unity are solutions to the polynomial $z^n - 1 = 0$, foundational in field theory and Galois theory.\n\n2. **In Fourier Analysis**:  \n   The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) uses primitive roots to decompose signals into frequency components.\n\n3. **In Number Theory**:  \n   Roots of unity appear in modular arithmetic, cyclotomic fields, and cryptography.\n\n## **Summary**\n\n- **Real Numbers**: Only $1$ and $-1$ are roots of unity, and $-1$ is primitive for $n = 2$.\n- **Complex Plane**: Extending to complex numbers introduces all $n$-th roots of unity, equally spaced on the unit circle.\n- **Primitive Roots**: These roots generate all other roots through successive powers, playing a central role in algebra, signal processing, and number theory.\n\n",
